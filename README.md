Loan Approval Prediction: A Data Science Journey üìä‚ú®

Welcome to my Loan Approval Prediction project, crafted as Task 2 of my Data Science Internship with Alfido Tech! This repository is a showcase of hands-on data science skills, from cleaning real-world data to building a predictive machine learning model. Using Python and powerful libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn, I‚Äôve created a robust pipeline to predict loan approvals with precision and insight. Ready to explore the art and science of financial decision-making? Let‚Äôs dive in! üöÄ

üéØ Objective

As part of my internship with Alfido Tech, this project aims to enhance my data science expertise by tackling a real-world problem: predicting loan approvals. The goals are:





Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and preprocess data for analysis.



Visualization: Create insightful plots to uncover patterns in the data.



Machine Learning: Build and evaluate a model to predict loan outcomes.

This project demonstrates practical skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning, making it a perfect blend of theory and application.

üìà Dataset

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle's Loan Approval Prediction Case Study, contains 614 loan applications with the following features:





Loan_ID: Unique identifier for each application



Gender: Male or Female



Married: Yes or No



Dependents: Number of dependents (0, 1, 2, 3+)



Education: Graduate or Not Graduate



Self_Employed: Yes or No



ApplicantIncome: Applicant‚Äôs income



CoapplicantIncome: Co-applicant‚Äôs income



LoanAmount: Requested loan amount (in thousands)



Loan_Amount_Term: Loan term (in months)



Credit_History: 1 (good) or 0 (bad)



Property_Area: Urban, Semiurban, or Rural



Loan_Status: Target variable (Y for approved, N for not approved)

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project leverages the following tools, as specified by Alfido Tech:





Python: The backbone of the project



Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical operations



Matplotlib & Seaborn: For stunning visualizations



Scikit-Learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model

üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project and explore the magic of data science:





Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/loan-approval-prediction.git
cd loan-approval-prediction

Replace username with your GitHub username.



Set Up the Environment:





Install dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib



If using Kaggle, the environment is pre-configured with these libraries.



Prepare the Dataset:





In Kaggle, attach the dataset (bhanupratapbiswas/loan-approval-prediction-case-study).



Locally, download loan_prediction.csv from Kaggle and place it in the project folder, updating the path in the notebook if needed.



Run the Notebook:





Open loan_approval_prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Kaggle.



Execute all cells to:





Clean the data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables)



Perform EDA with vibrant visualizations



Train a Random Forest Classifier



Evaluate the model with metrics and plots



Explore Outputs:





Visualizations: Saved as PNG files in /kaggle/working/ (Kaggle) or your local folder.



Model: Saved as loan_prediction_model.pkl for future use.

üîç Key Insights





Credit History Rules: The Random Forest model highlights Credit_History as the top predictor of loan approval, reflecting its critical role in financial decisions.



Model Performance: Achieves ~80% accuracy, with balanced precision and recall, making it reliable for predicting loan outcomes.



EDA Highlights:





Loan amounts are right-skewed, indicating most applicants request smaller loans.



Semiurban applicants have a higher approval rate, as seen in the data patterns.

üé® Visual Showcase

Check out these visualizations for a glimpse into the data:

Credit history steals the show, with income and loan amount as strong supporting actors.

The model nails most predictions, keeping false positives and negatives low.

üåü Why This Project Matters

This project is more than code‚Äîit‚Äôs a testament to my growth as a data scientist during my Alfido Tech internship. By tackling real-world data, I‚Äôve honed skills in:





Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and encoding categorical data



Visualization: Crafting intuitive plots to communicate insights



Machine Learning: Building and evaluating a predictive model

This work mirrors real-world applications, like helping banks make faster, fairer loan decisions. It‚Äôs a step toward mastering data science and making an impact!
